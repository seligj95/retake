# Neo (agent-21) — Design project persistence model & ProjectStore

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-20T19:58:39Z  
**Status:** Completed (282s)

## Deliverables

1. **ProjectStore Architecture** — Observable state holder for project data persistence
2. **Project Model** — Codable Swift struct for recordings, clips, cuts, timeline
3. **File Format** — JSON-based `.demoproject` format with versioning
4. **Persistence Layer** — FileManager abstraction for save/load/delete operations

## Key Decisions

- ProjectStore as source-of-truth for project state
- Async/await patterns for disk I/O operations
- Versioned project format for forward compatibility
- Directory-based storage in Application Support

## Related Tasks

- Phase 5: Recording engine generates raw footage
- Phase 6: Clip/cut editing applies to project model
- Phase 8: DemoRecorderApp wires up project storage
